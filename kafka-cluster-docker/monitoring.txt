    - The current capacity of the second survivor space.

S0U (Survivor Space 0 Utilization):    0.0 KB
    - The amount of space currently used in the first survivor space.

S1U (Survivor Space 1 Utilization):    4536.9 KB
    - The amount of space currently used in the second survivor space.

EC (Eden Space Capacity):              50176.0 KB
    - The current capacity of the Eden space (young generation).

EU (Eden Space Utilization):           28672.0 KB
    - The current usage of the Eden space.

OC (Old Generation Capacity):          993280.0 KB
    - The current capacity of the old generation space.

OU (Old Generation Utilization):       151834.5 KB

MC (Metaspace Capacity):               41728.0 KB
    - The current capacity of the metaspace (for class metadata).

MU (Metaspace Utilization):            41254.6 KB
    - The amount of space currently used in the metaspace.

CCSC (Compressed Class Space Capacity): 4992.0 KB
    - The current capacity of the compressed class space.

CCSU (Compressed Class Space Utilization): 4806.8 KB
    - The amount of space currently used in the compressed class space.

YGC (Young Generation Garbage Collections): 7
    - The number of young generation garbage collections.

YGCT (Young Generation Garbage Collection Time): 0.050 seconds
    - The total time spent in young generation garbage collections.

FGC (Full Garbage Collections): 0
    - The number of full garbage collections (old generation).

FGCT (Full Garbage Collection Time): 0.000 seconds
    - The total time spent in full garbage collections.

CGC (Concurrent Garbage Collections): 4
    - The number of concurrent garbage collections.

CGCT (Concurrent Garbage Collection Time): 0.009 seconds
    - The total time spent in concurrent garbage collections.

GCT (Total Garbage Collection Time): 0.060 seconds
    - Total time spent in all garbage collections.

Key Takeaway:
- Most memory is being used in the Eden and Old Generation spaces.
- Garbage collection has occurred primarily in the young generation (minor GC).
- No major (full) garbage collections have occurred, indicating good performance for now.
