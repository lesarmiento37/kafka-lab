# **Monitoring and Kafka Security**

## 1. Integration of Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Metricbeat in Docker

This project involves setting up an end-to-end logging and monitoring solution using Docker containers. The idea is to:

- **Kafka**: Act as a distributed message broker to handle high-throughput logs from various sources.
- **Elasticsearch**: Serve as the database backend, indexing the logs for querying and analysis.
- **Kibana**: Provide a visualization layer to explore and analyze the logs.
- **Metricbeat**: Collect and ship system metrics to Elasticsearch for performance monitoring.

The focus is on creating a cohesive stack where logs flow seamlessly through Kafka into Elasticsearch, and system metrics are visualized in Kibana. This setup is ideal for monitoring microservices or distributed applications.

## 2. Deploying an EC2 Instance with SSL Security

This project revolves around provisioning and securing an Amazon EC2 instance. The main objectives include:

- Launching an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console or automation tools like Terraform.
- Configuring a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to serve applications or websites.
- Setting up SSL/TLS encryption using certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt) or importing existing certificates.
- Verifying the HTTPS configuration to ensure secure data transfer and meeting compliance standards.

This project is ideal for understanding EC2 instance management, web server configuration, and SSL security implementation.

## 3. Integration of Prometheus and Grafana in Docker

The goal of this project is to build a monitoring and visualization solution with Prometheus and Grafana. The key components are:

- **Prometheus**: Act as a time-series database to scrape metrics from target applications and infrastructure.
- **Grafana**: Provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze the collected metrics through custom dashboards.
- Running both tools as Docker containers for portability and ease of setup.
- Configuring Prometheus to monitor specific services, such as application performance, server health, or database metrics.
- Designing Grafana dashboards to present actionable insights in real-time.

This project demonstrates the integration of open-source monitoring tools to gain visibility into system performance and improve operational efficiency.
